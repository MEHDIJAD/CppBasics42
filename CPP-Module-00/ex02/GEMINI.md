# Project Overview

This project is a C++ exercise focusing on implementing a simple `Account` class. The goal is to recreate the `Account.cpp` file based on the provided `Account.hpp` header and a log file (`19920104_091532.log`). The `tests.cpp` file provides the main function to test the implementation.

# Building and Running

**1. Build the project:**

Use the provided `Makefile` to compile the project.

```bash
make
```

**2. Run the tests:**

After a successful build, an executable file will be created (e.g., `run_tests`). Run this executable to test your implementation of the `Account` class.

```bash
./run_tests
```

**3. Verify the output:**

The output of the `run_tests` executable should match the content of the `19920104_091532.log` file (excluding timestamps).

# Development Conventions

*   The implementation of the `Account` class should be in the `Account.cpp` file.
*   The code should adhere to the style and structure of the provided `Account.hpp` and `tests.cpp` files.
*   The final output of the program must match the provided log file to pass the exercise.
